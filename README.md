Start with pip install trafficSimulator

trafficSimulator utilizes:
numpy 
scipy
dearpygui
uuid
collections
abc
math

trafficsim_short works, trafficsim doesn't yet.
I don't know if trafficsim_short is going to work for us when it comes to adding in performance metrics, so we may need to go back to a more verbose implementation like trafficsim.py

Persistent simulations of vehicles on multiple roads doesn't seem like it works like it should. More to troubleshoot.
